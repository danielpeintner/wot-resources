# WoT TD 1.0 Resources

Folder for resources that are next to the specification such as ontologies, context files and validation files.

TD 1.0 only contains the context file and the JSON Schema for validation.
Ontology files are simply taken over by the 1.1 version and they can be used by TD 1.0 users.

**Note:** The group had decided in the TD 1.1 work that the ontologies behind `https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/td`, `https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/json-schema`, `https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/security` and `https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/hypermedia` change to the 1.1 version. Thus, the same files are used for 1.0 and 1.1 ontologies.
